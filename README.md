# Galaxy_Potentials_and_Orbits_Integration
Galaxy_Potentials_and_Orbits_Integration simulation codes for the Física Galáctica class in Máster de Astrofísica of Universidad  de La Laguna.

It is necessary to install the numpy, matplotlib, astropy and gala Python packages for the codes to be executed.

In this GitHub repository we attach the simulation codes for the orbits of the Helmi streams members under the Milky Way potential and under the Milky Way and M31 composite potential. We give separate codes for each simulation (MW_potential and MW_and_M31_potential), and the complete code with the simulations included (Galactic_Orbits_whole_code.ipynb) and with other interesting results that were presented in the work where this repository is attached. We append in the mock_streams.ipynb file the code to calculate sections of the orbits at each timestep selected to retrieve the progenitor mass of the Helmi streams system by comparison with the simulations. We also attach the file we have used with all the available data necessary to run the codes of the Helmi streams members gaia_data.fits.
